<h3>Customize</h3>
<p>These models are customizable. We'll work together on things like:
    </p><ul>
    <li>Neck profile</li>
    <li>Pickups: P90s, single coils, or humbuckers - including 
        {{ with .Site.GetPage "guitars/pickups" }}
            <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">my custom-wound humbuckers</a>
        {{ end }}
    </li>
        <li>Control configuration</li>
    <li>Hardware selection and color</li>
    <li>Bridge style</li>
    <li>Wood selection</li>
    <li>Binding</li>
    <li>Inlays</li>
    <li>Finish</li>
    <li>...and more!</li>
    </ul>

    I focus on design elements that I think make great guitars - and the construction and processes that I can execute well. There are things I don't do because I don't believe they will allow me to deliver a guitar of the quality you deserve.
