I limit my active build queue to approximately 12 months. Interest beyond 12 months is moved to a waitlist which operates on a first-come-first-served basis. If you are interested in a commission guitar, please contact me at <a href="mailto:tak@makinoguitars.com">tak@makinoguitars.com</a>. I’ll place you on the waitlist and respond with an explanation of the process and offerings.
