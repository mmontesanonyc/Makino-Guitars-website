**What inspires you?** Your music may stand on the shoulders of giants - but it's *yours*. Your songs, your sound. Why should your guitar be any different? 

Makino Guitars evoke the spirit of traditional designs, but with distinctly original flair and customizable details that put your personality into your guitar - as much as you put it into your music.

I build guitars with a combination of traditional and modern methods. I use traditional hand tool woodworking techniques, and hand-rout guitar bodies and shape necks by hand. However, my design and production process include both modern processes like 3D printing and software modeling. 

Combine that with your choices, and we'll shape a guitar that's reminiscent of the instruments that defined rock and roll - but has its own personality as much as you do. The result is a guitar that will stand out on stage or in the studio the same way that you do.
