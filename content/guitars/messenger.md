Starts at $2300

The Messenger is the slimmer, bevel-bodied cousin of the Envoy. The Messenger shares the same offset body shape as the Envoy, but little else. It has its own voice and feel. 

The bevels serve both an aesthetic and ergonomic function, reflecting stage lights and tucking the guitar in close against the body. The Messenger can be built under 6.5lbs with appropriate wood selection. The mid-focused sound is sure to punch through the mix.

Standard features:
- 24.5" scale length
- 1 11/16” nut width
- 12” radius
- 22 frets
- Set neck construction
- Two-way truss rod
- Bone nut
- Switchcraft jack and switch, CTS pots
- Nitrocellulose lacquer finis
