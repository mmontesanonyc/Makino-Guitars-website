When I was young - maybe 5 or 6 years old - the cool older kid next door got an electric guitar for his birthday. I don’t think he ever learned to play it (I later saw it hidden in the corner of a bedroom closet). That didn’t matter. The damage was done. I knew the truth - guitars were cool; people who played guitar were cool.

Growing up, my parents eventually had to enforce a rule. If I wanted a toy I had to promise not to disassemble it to understand how the mechanism within functioned. Just how does a Transformer transform? I needed to understand. Once I got an electric guitar, the same drive to understand meant I was carelessly burning holes in my bedroom carpet with a soldering iron and leaving a trail of disassembled pickups and burnt out potentiometers in my wake. 

Today my relationship with guitars has evolved from one of curious destruction to one of informed creation. I build custom guitars for players who want what a mass-produced guitar cannot deliver: a one-of-a-kind instrument that speaks to their inspirations and their vision. A cohesive, system-level approach to building ensures that the components of the guitar work together to look, sound, and play the way you want. 

After all - guitars are cool, and people who play guitar are cool.
